Hello, I hope everyone is doing well.
This is our submission for the 2024 GDSC Solution Challenge, MEDIM; a medical app.
We've unfortunately only managed to do a prototype of the app on figma that you can navigate to here: https://www.figma.com/file/FrU29gNAnaTYRSlX62lBu1/prototype1?type=design&node-id=11%3A4&mode=design&t=LIFGQkrcE6vYPJbz-1
We have also prepared a presentation that you can find here explainning the features of our application :https://www.canva.com/design/DAF9yzJPJfs/xembPR1e4wphMnNqTcIH8g/edit?utm_content=DAF9yzJPJfs&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton
We hope this lives up to everyone's expectations, and we will be very excited to hear more news soon.
